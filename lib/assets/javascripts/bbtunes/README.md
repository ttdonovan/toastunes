# BBtunes a Backbone.js App

This app demos the use of Backbone.js and Rails 3.1 asset pipeline. To load the Backbone app append '?bb=true' to the URI.

### TODOs

  1. add test-js for Jasmine tests
  2. Cakefile for creating js src for test (?)
  3. look into 'rake assets:precompile' bbtunes-*.js is not getting generated in 'public/assets'
